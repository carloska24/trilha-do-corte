# Project: Trilha do Corte (Barber SaaS)

# Description: High-Tech/Cyberpunk Barber Shop Management System.

# 1. Tech Stack & Core Libraries

# - Frontend: React 19 + Vite

# - Language: TypeScript (Strict)

# - Styling: Tailwind CSS (Priority: Utility classes > Custom CSS)

# - Icons: Lucide React (Primary), Phosphor Icons (Secondary/Badges)

# - State: React Context API + LocalStorage (for persistence)

# - Animation: CSS Keyframes (Tailwind) or Framer Motion (only if complex)

# 2. Coding Standards

# - Components: Functional Components with named exports.

# - Props: Always define interface/type for Props (e.g., `interface HeaderProps {}`).

# - Logic: Extract complex logic to Custom Hooks (e.g., `usePromotions`, `useAppointments`).

# - Types: Centralize shared types in `src/types.ts`. Avoid `any`.

# - Imports: Absolute imports or consist relative imports. Group imports: React -> Libs -> Components -> Types.

# 3. UI/UX Guidelines (Cyberpunk Aesthetic)

# - Theme: Dark Mode Native. Backgrounds must be dark (#111, #151515, #0b0e14).

# - Colors:

# - Primary: Neon Yellow (#eab308) - Text-glow, borders, primary actions.

# - Secondary: Neon Purple (#a855f7) - AI features, creative badges.

# - Accent: Cyan/Blue (#06b6d4) - Information, tech details.

# - Effects:

# - Glassmorphism: `backdrop-blur-md` + `bg-black/50` or `bg-white/5`.

# - Glow: `drop-shadow-[0_0_10px_rgba(...)]` or box-shadows.

# - Typography: Uppercase headers (`font-graffiti` or Sans-Serif bold) + Mono details.

# - Responsiveness: Mobile-First approach. Test `md:` and `lg:` breakpoints.

# - Ensure touch targets are at least 44px.

# - Use drawers/modals for mobile interactions suitable.

# 4. Folder Structure Rules

# - `src/components/ui`: Reusable, dumb components (Buttons, Badges, Cards).

# - `src/components/dashboard`: Admin/Barber facing features.

# - `src/components/client`: End-user/Client facing features.

# - `src/hooks`: Custom hooks.

# - `src/types.ts`: Domain models.

# 5. Development Workflow (Agent Behavior)

# - When modifying UI: ALWAYS check if it matches the "High-Tech" aesthetic. No "Bootstrap-looking" components.

# - When adding data: Update `src/types.ts` first, then mock data in `src/constants.ts` (if applicable), then component.

# - When fixing bugs: removing specific "poluted" UI elements often yields better results than re-styling them.
